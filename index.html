        <h2>Game Overview</h2>
        <p>Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two
            teams of two players each (doubles). Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a
            hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. The object of the
            game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. The player
            who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.</p>
